This error occurs when you try to access a property of a state variable before it has been fully updated. This commonly happens when you update a state variable using `useState` or `useReducer` and then immediately try to use the new value in a subsequent line of code.  React's state updates are asynchronous, meaning that the update won't be reflected immediately.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(count); // This will log the OLD value of count
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
