The solution is to rely on React's re-rendering mechanism to access the updated state.  The updated state will be reflected in the component's next render cycle.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>  {/*The updated count will be displayed here after re-render*/}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
By removing the `console.log(count)` from the `incrementCount` function, and relying on the re-rendering to reflect changes, we access the correct updated state value.
